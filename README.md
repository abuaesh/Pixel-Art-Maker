# Pixel Art Maker Project

##This is a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas!

The interface is built using HTML and CSS. JavaScript code is used to let the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

Users are be able to:

- Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
- Choose a color.
- Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
